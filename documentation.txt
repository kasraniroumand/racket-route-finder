Classes and Their Roles

station%: Represents a station in the transportation network. Each station has a name and a line-name.

connection%: Represents a connection between two stations, including the stations (station1 and 
station2) and the travel time (time) between them.

graph%: Represents the entire network graph. It maintains a list of stations and their connections. Key functionalities include adding stations and connections, populating the graph from a predefined list, finding paths between two stations, and displaying the graph.



Key Methods

add-or-get-station (in graph%): Adds a new station to the graph or retrieves it if it already exists.

add-connection (in graph%): Adds a connection between two stations.

populate-graph (in graph%): Populates the graph with a list of predefined connections.

find-two-paths (in graph%): Finds up to two paths between two specified stations.

display-graph (in graph%): Prints the graph's stations and their connections to the console.

print-paths: Utility function to print the paths found between two stations.

get-shortest-path: Finds the shortest path among the given paths based on total travel time.

get-path-with-fewest-station-changes: Finds the path with the fewest station changes among the given paths.

GUI Components

Main Window (main-frame): Contains input fields for source and destination stations, a process button to find routes, and output fields for displaying the shortest path and the path with the fewest station changes.

Second Window (second-frame): Contains input fields for adding new stations and connections, and a button to add the specified connection.
